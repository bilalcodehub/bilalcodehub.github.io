# 2D Medical Imaging Analysis using fast.ai

Firstly, my sincere gratitude to **Jeremy Howard** for authoring fast.ai which is an incredible software for democratising deep learning to solve problems of your own interest.


## Problem Description

This project an example of using fast.ai with 2D medical imaging data. So I will analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and then use it to train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.
You will be provided with the medical images with clinical labels for each image that were extracted from their accompanying radiology reports.
The project will include access to a GPU for fast training of deep learning architecture, as well as access to 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients.
